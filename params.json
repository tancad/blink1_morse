{"name":"Blink1 morse","tagline":"Translates text into blinkenlights!","body":"# blink1-tool morse code wrapper\r\nThis is a small python script that wraps around the blink1-tool for the command line. It translates the command line input text into [morse code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) and emits them through the blink1. \r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n* Make sure you have [downloaded the right version of the blink1-tool](http://blink1.thingm.com/blink1-tool/) for your OS. \r\n* Set the BLINK_TOOL_PATH in morse.py to the full path to your blink1-tool\r\n* That should be it! \r\n\r\n## Gosh, this code is ugly!\r\nYup, it is. It's a quick hack with some features added as an afterthought. But it seems to work. If you want to rewrite it or make it less ugly: Go for it!\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n```\r\nusage: morse.py [-h] [-c COLOR] [-s] [-tc TARGET_COLOR] [-t TIME] [-r REPEAT]\r\n                text\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  text                  This is the text that should be emitted\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  -c COLOR, --color COLOR\r\n                        The (initial) color of the blinks.

If yes: --target-color needs\r\n                        to be specified\r\n  -tc TARGET_COLOR, --target-color TARGET_COLOR\r\n                        The final color of the blinks.

Default: 100\r\n  -r REPEAT, --repeat REPEAT\r\n                        How many times should the message repeat? Default: 1\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-684315-17","note":"Don't delete this file!
